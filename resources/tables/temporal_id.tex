    \caption{Temporal consistency metrics. Encoder based methods display improved identity preservation at the local (adjacent frame) level, but show considerable identity drift over time. PTI, preserves a greater degree of global identity, at the cost of local jitter from inconsistent pivots. Our pipeline outperforms the alternatives and achieves a local-identity preservation score which is nearly equal to the original video (1), demonstrating our ability to maintain a high degree of consistency.}
